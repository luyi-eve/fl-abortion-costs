## Goals

The overall goal of this project is to understand the potential financial predicament arose from the end of Roe that women may risk undergoing through a deep analysis of the nonmedical costs on transportation and lodging expenses for an abortion round trip in Florida. It also tries to deliver informative messages to people who need help with selection of abortion care in the particular region. 

## Data and Methodology

Most coverage on abortion issues published by many big news outlets focuses on a nationwide situation, but even though some may include detailed statistics by state, clean and updated regional data aren't usually accessible on national public databases. In light of this, I am prompted to build my own datasets from scratch in terms of abortion access particularly in Florida. Thereby, most data that you've read about in the story were collected and analyzed by me. I also used related statstics and information processed and published by the government and non-profit organizations. 

If you want to check the datasets that I built for this story and other sources I cited, you can visit [Datasets and Sources](https://luyi-eve.github.io/fl-abortion-costs/about-and-sources#datasets-and-sources) to further explore. If you're interested in reading more about how I collected the data to built my own datasets, the [methodology]() contains multiple step-by-step approaches of data collection and analysis of mine.


## Skills and Tools

For this project, I learned multiple approaches to cross-check various sources when building regional datasets. I also practiced and taught myself to create interactive graphics and dynamic webpages by applying customized functions using JavaScript. Previously, I had only worked with Python, HTML/CSS and  data visualization tools suchs as Adobe Illustrator, Mapbox, QGIS, Datawrapper/Flourish, and I had little experiences in interactive design.
